# Median PageSpeed Insights

Measures site performance multiple times via Google PageSpeed Insights and outputs the median value between measurements.

## Why?

Performance of any complex site tends to fluctuate.
Unfortunately, these fluctuations affect Google PSI results, thus the only way to get real numbers is to perform multiple measurements.

But guess what? **Doing things manually sucks!** 

That's why I built this simply stupid page to automate PSI interaction process.
